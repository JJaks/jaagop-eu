I got myself a new job couple of months ago and went from writing in Typescript and using Aurelia webpack to Magento 2.
This is a short summary of what my experience has been:
* got myself thrown into a project that was(is still) a complete mess
* Amasty modules (if you actually know Amasty modules then you know that they're a bitch to customize)
* PHP
* LESS (I actually love Less, in my honest opinion it's almost as good as Sass)
